        <p>A croissant is a laminated, yeast-leavened bakery product that contains dough/roll-in fat layers to create a flaky, crispy texture. Croissants belong to the Viennoiserie or pastry category of baked goods along with brioche, Danish and puff pastries.</p>

        <p>Baguette, a long, thin, crusty loaf of French bread. Tens of millions of baguettes are made and eaten around the world every day, making the baguette one of the most popular breads. It is one of the preeminent symbols of French cuisine, and, as such, it is a major point of cultural pride and culinary identity for the French and francophone countries.</p>

        <p>Moroccan bread is kind of unique yet very familiar in taste and texture. Moroccan bread, or at least the recipe I am sharing with you today, is kind of a cross between focaccia and your classic country bread. It's a very simple and beginner friendly recipe.</p>
